Diagram Meeting 01
<April 5, 2021>

Discussed:
	When we get to iteration 3, we'll combine similar use cases together to
	reduce the number of diagrams that need to be made.
	
	Diagrams are based on the Iteration 2 files that Charlie sent. We'll then
	be dividing the use cases amongst our 4 members, and finishing it by 
	April 8 (We'll then meet up at that date and compile our diagrams before
	starting work on Iteration 3 diagram)
