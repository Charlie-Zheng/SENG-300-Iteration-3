To start running the GUI, run the GUIMainClass.java file

There will be two screens presented: the fullscreen one is the GUI. The windowed one is an options panel for the user to simulate physical actions that would not appear on the real GUI.

To start, an attendant must log in to start the Checkout. The preset attendant number/pin combos are:
Number: 1234	Pin: 1234
